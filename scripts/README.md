# scripts

There are multiple scripts, but the applications don't have to include
them individually, the `helper.sh` can be used for convenience.

## `scripts/helper.sh`

A convenience script, which includes most of the individual scripts.

## `scripts/common-build.sh`

A script that defines the `common_build()` function, which can be
called in the application build scripts to perform the full build.
